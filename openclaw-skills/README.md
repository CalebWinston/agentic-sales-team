## Tonalities

| Flag | Style |
|------|-------|
| `--direct` | No fluff (default) |
| `--blunt` | Shortest possible |
| `--challenger` | Push back, teach |
| `--exec` | C-suite brevity |
| `--friendly` | Add warmth |

### Examples

**Direct (default):**
```
Subject: Sales cycles

Sarah - saw the Series B.

Question: how are you handling longer sales cycles as you scale?

We helped Datadog cut theirs by 30%.

15 min to see if relevant?
```

**Blunt:**
```
Subject: Quick question

Sarah - are slow sales cycles costing you deals?

If yes, let's talk. If no, ignore this.
```

**Challenger:**
```
Subject: The real problem with Series B scaling

Sarah - most companies focus on hiring more reps.

The ones that win focus on cycle time first.

Worth a contrarian take?
```
