## Discovery Framework

### BANT Check
- **Budget:** What's allocated? Who controls it?
- **Authority:** Who decides? Who influences?
- **Need:** What problem? How painful? What's the cost of inaction?
- **Timeline:** When do they need to decide? What's driving it?

### Pain Questions
1. "What's not working today?"
2. "How long has this been a problem?"
3. "What have you tried?"
4. "What happens if you don't solve this?"
5. "What does success look like?"

### Quantify the Pain
- "How much time does this take?"
- "What's the cost when [problem] happens?"
- "How many [deals/customers/hours] are affected?"

## Proposal Framework

### Structure
1. **Executive Summary** (1 paragraph)
   - Their problem, our solution, expected outcome

2. **Understanding** (half page)
   - Restate their situation and goals
   - Shows you listened

3. **Solution** (1 page)
   - What we'll do
   - How it works
   - Implementation timeline

4. **Investment** (half page)
   - Pricing tiers
   - What's included
   - ROI justification

5. **Next Steps** (bullet list)
   - Clear path to start

### Pricing Presentation
- Always anchor high
- Present 3 options when possible
- Show ROI before price
- Make "no" harder than "yes"

## Negotiation Tactics

### Price Objections

**"Too expensive"**
- "Compared to what?"
- "What were you expecting?"
- "If I could get the price to X, would you sign today?"

**"Can you do better on price?"**
- "What price would work? And what would you need to cut to get there?"
- "Help me understand - is this about budget or value?"

**"Competitor is cheaper"**
- "What are you comparing? Let me make sure it's apples to apples."
- "What would you lose by going with them?"

### Stall Tactics

**"We need to think about it"**
- "Of course. What specifically do you need to think through?"
- "What would help you decide faster?"

**"Send me the contract and I'll review"**
- "Happy to. When should I follow up? Tomorrow or Thursday?"
- "What questions do you expect to have?"

### The Assumptive Close
- "So we're looking at the [tier] plan starting [date]. I'll send the contract today - who should I copy?"

### The Takeaway
- "Based on timeline, this might not be the right fit right now. Should we revisit in [timeframe]?"

---

## Contract Process

### Before Sending
- [ ] Pricing matches verbal agreement
- [ ] Terms reviewed by legal (if needed)
- [ ] Start date confirmed
- [ ] Signatory identified

### Follow-up Cadence
| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 0 | Send contract |
| 1 | "Did you receive it okay?" |
| 3 | "Any questions?" |
| 5 | "Is [signatory] available to review?" |
| 7 | Call + "Any blockers?" |
| 10 | "What would help move this forward?" |

## Deal Revival

### Stalled Deal Triggers
- No activity in 7+ days
- Missed meeting
- Contract sent but not signed (5+ days)

### Revival Approaches

**The Direct:**
"Hey [Name] - deal's gone quiet. What's going on?"

**The Value Add:**
"Saw [relevant news]. Thought of you. Still make sense to connect?"

**The Break-up:**
"Haven't heard back - assume timing isn't right. I'll close this out on my end. If things change, you know where to find me."

### On Every Loss
