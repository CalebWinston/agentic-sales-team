## Objection Handling

### "Not interested"
**Diagnose:** Real objection or brush-off?

**Responses:**
1. "Fair enough. What would make it interesting?"
2. "Got it. Mind if I ask what you're focused on instead?"
3. "No problem. If [trigger event] changes, worth revisiting?"

### "Using competitor"
**Diagnose:** Happy or stuck?

**Responses:**
1. "How's that going? What would you change if you could?"
2. "Makes sense. When does that contract come up?"
3. "Got it. [Competitor] is solid for [X]. We focus on [Y]."

### "No budget"
**Diagnose:** Timing or priority issue?

**Responses:**
1. "If budget wasn't an issue, would this be worth exploring?"
2. "Understood. When does planning for next [quarter/year] start?"
3. "What would need to happen to create budget?"

### "Send me info"
**Diagnose:** Interest or blow-off?

**Responses:**
1. "Happy to. Quick call helps me send the RIGHT info. 10 minutes?"
2. "Sure. What specifically would be most useful?"
3. "Will do. What's the best way to follow up after you review?"

### "Not the right time"
**Diagnose:** When is right?

**Responses:**
1. "When does [initiative] kick off? I'll circle back then."
2. "What's driving the timeline?"
3. "If timing changes, what would trigger it?"

### "Need to talk to team"
**Diagnose:** Real or stall?

**Responses:**
1. "Want me to join that conversation?"
2. "Happy to help build the case. What questions will they have?"
3. "Who else should I loop in?"

## Call Scripts

### Cold Call Opener (5 seconds)
"Hi [Name], this is [You] from [Company]. Did I catch you at an okay time?"

*If yes:* Continue to hook
*If no:* "When's better - tomorrow morning or afternoon?"

### Hook (10 seconds)
"I noticed [signal]. Quick question: is [pain] something you're dealing with?"

### Discovery Questions
- "Walk me through how you're handling [process] today."
- "What's working? What's not?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"
- "What happens if this doesn't get solved?"

### Close for Meeting
"Based on what you've shared, I think it's worth 15 minutes. How's [specific time]?"

## Voicemail Rules

- 12-18 seconds MAX
- ONE idea per voicemail
- Sound busy - you don't NEED them
- Create a curiosity gap
- No phone number (caller ID)
- End mid-thought or with quiet confidence

### Templates

**The Observation:**
"Hey [Name], it's [You]. So I noticed you're hiring three SDRs while also rolling out a new CRM... and I'm curious how you're thinking about that. Anyway, call me back."

**The Number:**
"[Name], [You]. 47 days. That's the average ramp time we're seeing with teams your size. Thought you'd want to know how. Call me."

**The Exit:**
"[Name], [You]. Last voicemail from me - I know when to take a hint. If [pain] ever keeps you up at night, you've got my number. If not, no worries. Best of luck."
